# SFCC-DW-Helper
Small extension to help the **SFCC (SalesForce Commerce Cloud)** developers, to edit the **dw.json** file and run commands of **Prophet**.

## Why is Extension?
Simplify the life to **SFCC developers**, with an extension that provides direct edition of **dw.json** and the possibility of run **Prophet** commands on the same sidebar.

The extension validates the mandatory fields that the **dw.json** require to connect with an **SFCC** environment, that are necessary for **Prophet** uploads the code and to start a debug. 


The main commands **Clean Project/Upload All**, **Enable Upload** and **Disable Upload**, are present on the sidebar, for quick execution of them.
